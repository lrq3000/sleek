# sleek

## sleek is currently being rewritten
Thank you for your continued support of this application. The community surrounding it has grown significantly over time, and the numerous feature requests and bug reports demonstrate the ongoing interest and potential for further improvement.

However, I recognize that I cannot accomplish this alone. To foster greater collaboration and participation, it is crucial that the codebase is accessible. Currently, this is not the case, which explains the limited contributions from others. Therefore, I am in the process of rewriting sleek using React, which will result in a significantly smaller codebase. I will also ensure that it adheres more closely to the specifications of Electron.

My objective is to release version 2.0 of sleek with the same set of features found in version 1.3.1. However, please note that the application will undergo a complete overhaul beneath the surface. Once this foundational work is complete, I will be able to focus on developing new features. I sincerely hope that this endeavor will attract a broader range of contributors who will support me in achieving these goals.

In the meantime, I invite you to explore the current state of development on GitHub at the following link: https://github.com/ransome1/sleek/tree/2.x. This will give you an opportunity to see the progress I've made so far.

If you're interested and eager to contribute, you can already begin working on tasks and features that are still pending. You can find an overview of these tasks in the project board located at https://github.com/users/ransome1/projects/3/views/1.

Feel free to explore the codebase and project board, and if you're passionate about any particular tasks or features, don't hesitate to start working on them. Your contributions will be greatly appreciated and will help propel the development of sleek to new heights.

sleek is an open-source (FOSS) todo manager based on the todo.txt syntax. Stripped down to only the most necessary features, and with a clean and simple interface, sleek aims to help you focus on getting things done.

All classic todo.txt attributes are supported and enhanced by additional features. Creating todos is straightforward, and tag-based filtering in tandem with highly customisable grouping and smart full-text search allow for rapid information retrieval. Completed todos can be hidden or archived into separate done.txt files. Easy integration with other todo.txt apps is facilitated by continuously scanning todo.txt files for changes.

sleek is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux, and in several languages. For a detailed list of features, see below. Many useful information can be found in <a href="https://github.com/ransome1/sleek/wiki">sleek's wiki</a>.
